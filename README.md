# Jet Wallet

### issues: 
The smart contracts are not functioning or even concrete ideas, just exploring currently.

The reducer is currently broken so the state is not being updated.  The interfaces need to be reworked most likely

Currently this repo requires an .env with SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true unfortunately...
